# Hello QueenBees!

Welcome to our repository for our incredibly useful and exciting website. Here you will find our code for all aspects of our project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our project, INSERT NAME HERE, will allow a user to upload a photo and view the color pallete and compatibility of the colors in the image. Our website will accept images of outfits, where we will cut the subject from the photo (ignoring the background), and also images of rooms or settings to analyze. We will also provide hex color codes and RGB information.

We hope this project will enable the creativity of our users and provide them helpful feedback on their outfits, homes, and more!
